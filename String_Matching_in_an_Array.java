/*Given an array of string words, return all strings in words that is a substring of another word. You can return the answer in any order.
A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string
Example 1:
Input: words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]
Output: ["as","hero"]

["hero","as"] is also a valid answer.
Example 2:
Input: words = ["leetcode","et","code"]
Output: ["et","code"]
Explanation: "et", "code" are substring of "leetcode". */
